# Computer Science Student and future Everest summiter

I am a Computer Science student at North Carolina State University with a passion for exploring the frontiers of technology. With experience as a Site Reliability Engineer and a solid foundation in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Operating Systems, I am eager to drive innovations in autonomous vehicles and system-level software. My curiosity fuels my commitment to staying updated with the latest advancements in tech, constantly seeking opportunities to learn and contribute to cutting-edge solutions.

Currently, I am working on an Independent Study around Data for ADAS and related models, Parallel Systems, Autonomous Driving as part of my coursework at NCSU. I am also learning about Golang in an effort to make a robust application "SchedSync" â€“ which you can check out on my Github. In my previous semester, I got experience in Software Engineering, Operating Systems, and Social Computing and Decentralized AI.

Beyond my professional aspirations, I am an avid soccer, cricket, and Formula 1 fan, as well as a passionate trekker and traveler, always eager to explore new places and perspectives. I believe in combining creativity, collaboration, and technical expertise to make a meaningful impact. I am actively seeking tech internships across the US to further develop my skills and contribute to transformative projects. Letâ€™s connect and create something extraordinary together!
